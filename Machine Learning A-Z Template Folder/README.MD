__Machine Learning is the Future__

In the 21st century, data is everywhere. 
- Until 2005 - Humans have created 130 Exabytes of Data.
- In 2010 - 1200 Exabytes of Data.
- In 2015 - 7900 Exabytes of Data.
- In 2015 - 40900 Exabytes of Data. (estimated)

Machine Learning presents a potential to use this data and add value from the data that is growing exponentially.
